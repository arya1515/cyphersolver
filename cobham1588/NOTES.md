# Lord Cobham to Walsingham, May–June 1588 (BL Harley MS 287, DECODE R8490/R8492/R8495/R8496): key partly rebuilt, not read

Catalogue item: "Cobham (Belgia) to Walsingham, 4 ciphertexts" (DECODE R8490, R8492, R8495, R8496; rule-scored).
Outcome: **attempted, open.** The cipher system has been identified and most of its alphabet has been rebuilt from
the decrypted sibling letters in the same volume. Only fragments of the four letters read with confidence.

## The documents

William Brooke, 10th Lord Cobham, was one of Elizabeth's commissioners at the Bourbourg peace talks with Parma's
deputies (spring–summer 1588). His letters to Walsingham are in clear English. Short passages and single words are
in cipher, set into the running text.

| DECODE | Harley 287 | date, place | pages with cipher | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R8490 | ff. 80–81 | Ostend, 5 May 1588 | f. 80r (about 12 cipher groups), f. 81 (2 lines) | "Julio Romeo, Cristophero Mondragon" and "Doctor Dale" in clear |
| R8492 | f. 88 | undated, 1588 | f. 88r: the densest cipher (about 14 lines) | "captain Montgomery ... of late gone into Scotland ... with 40 men of ..." |
| R8495 | ff. 92–93 | 27 May 1588 ("Belgia") | f. 92r, about 8 lines | news: the Armada still at Lisbon, Gonzaga, 200 mariners at Sluys |
| R8496 | ff. 96–97 | Bourbourg ("Binborow"), 9 June 1588 | ff. 96r–97r, scattered | |

DECODE R8497 (Harley 287 f. 187, "The Cowler Cipher for Mr Bodley ... in the Low Countries", December 1590) is the
key record the catalogue pointed at. It is **Bodley's** cipher of 1590, a different alphabet, and does not
apply to these letters.

## Prior art

- CSP Foreign vol. 21 pt 4 (Jan–June 1588) calendars the Cobham letters in SP 77 (Flanders), for example 1 May,
  3 June, 6 June and 10 June. It does not calendar these Harley 287 letters. No printed decipherment was found.
- DECODE marks the sibling Cobham letters in the same volume as **Decrypted**: R8481 (f. 63, Mar 1587/8),
  R8488 (ff. 75–76, Ostend 9 Apr 1588), R8489 (ff. 78–79, Apr 1588), R8493 (f. 89). Their cipher passages carry
  a contemporary **interlinear decipherment**. They are the source of the key below.
- A second session (cypher-7e, folder `harley287`) is working the same system on R8477–R8487 (Ostend, March
  1587/8). Key notes were exchanged on 21 Sept 2026.

## The system

A **monoalphabetic substitution with homophones** in Greek-like letters, arbitrary signs and a few Latin letter
shapes. Nulls are dots, dashes and ".." marks, though ".." also stands for u/v. A few signs are **code signs**; a
square (◻) is one. Word division is mostly kept. It is the same system as the glossed March–April letters.

Key rebuilt from the glosses of f. 75 (R8488: "upon our arrival", "willing to harken", "by the clergy they made
means", "discours", "sent from", "their great desir of", "cardinal is coming", "the pope's legate", "the Duke of
Parma his bastard son") and f. 89 (R8493: "what may be", "further hoped for at their hands", "our abode in this
towne is so advantagious"). The sign names are descriptive:

| plain | signs |
|---|---|
| a | U / ∪ |
| b | + |
| c | 8 |
| d | ∞ |
| e | 7 |
| f | H |
| g | crossed X (Ж) |
| h | ϸ (loop on a long stem) |
| i | ⊥, X (undotted) |
| k | ω |
| l | ϕ (small loop), L, and ".." after a letter (cypher-7e) |
| m | ∝ (loop with tail) |
| n | ǂǂ (double-barred cross) |
| o | Z (z-shape), c, d |
| p | ϑ |
| r | V, γ |
| s, t | Λ (two near-identical forms; not separated) |
| u / v | "..", ":" |
| w | ẋ (dotted x) |
| y | γ |

Doubtful or missing: j, q, x, z. There are unidentified signs on f. 88 (K, υ, ρ, W) and unnamed code signs. Because
the s/t and r/y signs are shared, a letter-by-letter reading needs a clean sign-level transcription. This session
did not make one.

## What reads

Fragments only, grade M (probable) unless marked:

- f. 80r: "hoping them in the ◻ [code] …ances for what chaunces so ever" (the cipher word ends -ances); "it will
  not be … the ho-v-en [haven?] is …" (uncertain); "in all ΛVZΛTΛ in numbers, that at the ΛVZΛT …, which was
  the 20" — the word could not be resolved: ARMADA does not fit the key (V = r, Z = o).
- f. 92r: "imprisoned in …", "it is reported that they have … of letters" (ϕ7ΛΛ..⊥VΛ, l-e-t-t-[e]-r-s, H).
- f. 88r: the clear frame reads "There is captain Montgomery of late gone into Scotland" [cipher] "with 40 men of"
  [cipher] "which have promised the" [cipher] "15 of late there is" …. The cipher words contain signs not in the
  table.

## What would finish it

1. A sign-level transcription of the cipher passages on ff. 80r, 81, 88r, 92r and 96r–97r, from full-resolution
   crops (the images are 7200×10200 px, so each passage can be cut at about 4× reading size).
2. Separate the two Λ forms (s/t) and the r/y signs from the glossed siblings, if they differ at all.
3. Merge with cypher-7e's `harley287` key for R8477–R8487.
4. Read the passages. The letters are in plain English and the context is known (Bourbourg talks, Armada news).

Status: attempted, key partly rebuilt, open.
- Cross-link: cypher-7e read R8482-R8487 (docs/harley287.html, harley287/key.tsv); its key has narrow ∧ = s, wide ∧ = t.

## Second pass, 21 Sept 2026 (with the harley287 key)

Close crops (about 1.2× the full-resolution scan) of ff. 80r, 88r and 92r. Sign copies below are as seen; "?" is an
unidentified sign. The narrow and wide ∧ forms and the ϕ-family (l / p / h) cannot be told apart reliably at this
resolution, so the readings are from context and graded M or I.

f. 80r
- "and to our drag our forces ffrō c VIII8 f hoping them X ǂǂ ∧ϸ7 ◻ ϸ∪ǂǂ87∧ for what chaunces so ever you bestow
  (and that must be great) it will ǂǂc∧ -7 WLϕ∧· ∧ϸ7 ϸo··7ǂǂ ⊥∧ Xd+o:·87 ) and me[mo] c: other wind hath blown …"
  - "them in the ◻-pances": probably "expences" with ◻ standing for ex- (M). "it will not be … the haven(?) is …" (I).
- "yf honorable for 7/∧c∂ oo7ϸ… ∪ǂǂ∧ϕ… (a long run, unread)", "as usuall in all ∧VZ∧T∧ in numbers, that at the
  ∧VZ∧T c ǂǂ-V7oo which was the 20 and the ∧··- ⊥Ӿ8∧" (unread; ARMADA does not fit).

f. 88r
- "There is captain Montgomery of late gone into Scotland. 8⊥ϸ? ω c ǂǂ K ∪ ϕϕ ∧ ρ c V X ϸ with 40 men of ⊃8cǂǂ∪ have
  promised ∧ϸ7 [the] ϸo··Lǂǂ of V∪+ǂǂ ∩ϕd∧ yn X c·⊥V∪ ∧ϸ7V to 15: of late there is …" (unread beyond "the").
- next line: "… ∧7HLV∤∧ which have ⊃ẋV∧ ϕ7ǂǂ∧∤cǂǂ ϕcǂǂ∧ϸϕT …" (unread).

f. 92r (27 May), after "200 mariners of Hambourgh that were at Sluys are returned to Dunkerk"
- "⊥7ẋ⊥∧ ϕ⊥ẋϸϕ7ǂǂ and 8-ϕ⊥∪V ⊥cǂǂ ∩cǂǂ sent by …", "imprisoned in -V+o∓7∧. It is reported that they have 8ϸcVX
  …", "of ϕ7∧∧··⊥V∧ which …" = "of letters" (M).

Verdict of the second pass: not readable from the scans at sign level by this method. What would move it is a
human transcription at the BL (or the DECODE images at full zoom, glyph by glyph, with a sign inventory drawn
from the glossed ff. 75 and 89 first).

## Third pass, 21 Sept 2026: sign inventory by eye from the glossed leaves

At full scan resolution (7200 px wide) the signs are clear. About 60 glossed words on f. 75 (R8488), f. 79 (R8489,
16 April 1588, the richest) and f. 89 (R8493) were aligned sign by sign; the result is `signs.tsv`. What it settles:

- The families that looked alike separate cleanly: **p** = loop with its tail swept down-left (upon, popes, perswade,
  prelates, persons); **l** = circle crossed by a straight stem (arrival, legat, holding, stil); **h** = stem with a
  bowl to the right (the, harken, thought, hands); **m** = horizontal S with a loop (made, means, perform, coming,
  commission, him); **w** = dot and stroke (willing, newe, sworne, warres, wel).
- The system is **more homophonic, and more polyphonic, than any key so far allowed**: ∧ is s *and* t (and, on
  f. 80, probably a); γ is r *and* y; c is o and once a; ϕ is l and once t. That, not the image, is why the four
  May–June letters do not fall to substitution.
- **Code numbers** are glossed: 7 = her Majesty, 10 = the Lord Admiral, 15 = the Duke of Parma, 16 = the King of
  Spain.

New readings in the target letters (grade M unless stated):

- f. 80r: "as usuall in all **armadas** in numbers, that at the **armada** …, which was the 20" — ∧V∽∧ŧ∧ with
  ∽ = m (glossed) forces ARMADA if the wide ∧ is a and ŧ is d. "hoping them in the ◻**pances**" (ϑ = p, glossed):
  "expences" with ◻ an unglossed sign (M). A run with vertical word-dividers ends "… **to these termes**"
  (∧z | ∧ϸ7∧ | ∧cV∽7∧, with c = e) (M). Last lines: "… **22** is … in the **action** … that he promised
  **Q[ueen]**: … 27 to begin …" (codes 22, 27 unglossed).
- f. 88r: "15:" is **the Duke of Parma**. The opening cipher probably begins "**captain** …" (8⊥ϑ∧…ǂǂ) before a
  name, then "with 40 men of …, [who] have promised the …". The rest turns on signs no gloss shows (L, K).
- f. 92r: "**4** sent by ϑoc··Ӿϕc∧" — perhaps "Portugals" (I); "of **letters**" (M).

Verdict: the sign inventory is now fixed and published; the letters remain unread because several signs are
polyphonic and a few are unglossed. The next step is not more image work but a solver: treat each sign as a set of
possible letters (from `signs.tsv`), enumerate the readings of each cipher word against an English 1580s word list,
and let the clear context choose. That is mechanical and can be scripted from a sign-level transcription of the
runs, which the crops in this pass make possible.

## Fourth pass, 21 Sept 2026: candidate-set solver

`runs.txt` holds a sign-level transcription of 22 cipher runs (ff. 80, 88, 92) in an ASCII sign code. `solve.py` gives
each sign its set of letters from `signs.tsv`, enumerates each cipher word's readings, and scores them against
`wordfreq.tsv` (25,488 words from CSP Foreign vol. 21 pt 4, Jan–June 1588, 266,800 words, plus Gutenberg English
and the glossed plaintext). Elizabethan spelling is normalised (u/v, i/j/y, doubled letters, final e). A fuzzy pass
allows one wrong, extra or missing sign (two for words of 7+ signs). Output: `solve_out.txt`.

Words the solver confirms in context (exact match unless marked "near"):
- f. 80: "in **the** [◻] …", "it will **not be** … **the** …", "to **these** **terms**" (near), "all **armada(s)**",
  "at the **armada** (near: arms) **on** …", "in the **action** (near) that he promised Q[ueen]".
- f. 88: "**captain** (near, 2) …", "have promised **the** …", "in **years**(?) **there** to 15".
- f. 92: "of **letters** (near, 2)", "they have **charge** …", "**clear**" (near), "**legat**" (near).

The long runs (f. 80g, f. 88a second word, f. 88b–d, f. 92a–b, d) find no sensible word, even with two edits. That
points at the transcription of those runs, not the key: the next step is to re-read just those runs at full
resolution with the solver's near-candidates in view, correct `runs.txt`, and rerun. The solver makes that loop
quick.
