# Phelipeaux d'Herbault to Béthune, 13 February 1626 (BnF fr. 3669 no. 25)

**Status: read (18 Sept 2026), and the catalogue's premise corrected.** Catalogue item 27 listed this as
"the one letter without decipherment among ~30 of 1625–26" and set as the first task: *"Check that no. 26
is not simply the decipherment of no. 25."* It effectively is. **No. 26 is not a second letter: it is the
same letter of 13 February 1626, carrying the same cipher, with the plaintext written between the lines by
a contemporary decipherer.** So no. 25 is not an undeciphered text at all — its reading has been sitting
three folios away since 1626. The letter is in `ct/letter_13feb1626.md`.

## 1. The documents

Gallica ark `btv1b9060205q` (fr. 3669, *Recueil de lettres originales*, anc. 9163), 120 canvases, each a
black-and-white microfilm frame of a double-page opening, about 8,420 × 5,950 px. **Canvas = folio + 5**,
fixed on the foliation of f. 70 (canvas 75) and f. 73 (canvas 78).

| piece | leaves | canvases | cipher |
|---|---|---|---|
| 24 — Herbault → Béthune, 6 Feb 1626 | f. 67–68 | 72–73 | no cipher noted |
| **25 — Herbault → Béthune, 13 Feb 1626** | **ff. 69–71** | **74–76** | **cipher, no decipherment** |
| 26 — the same letter, 13 Feb 1626 | ff. 72–74 | 77–79 | cipher **with interlinear decipherment** |
| 27 — Louis XIII → Béthune | f. 75– | 80– | cipher and decipherment |

Both copies are made up as letters for sending: each has its own address leaf with a wax seal and a
docket ("Receu le …, 13 febvrier 1626"). No. 25 opens on f. 69r with the marginal note *"Le roy fera
responce"*; no. 26 opens identically on f. 72r. The clear text of the two runs word for word — the same
paragraphs on Rambouillet's delay for Spain, the promotion of cardinals and Marquemont's hat, the courier
sent on the 6th through the Venetian ambassador Contarini, the peace with the Huguenots, the prince of
Piedmont's arrival — and the cipher stands at the same points in both.

## 2. The identification, and why it is safe

Three things establish that no. 26 reads no. 25 rather than merely resembling it:

1. **The clear text is identical**, paragraph by paragraph, including incidental detail (the King's sore
   toe from an ingrown nail, the memoir of Cardinal Bevilacqua for Horatio Giraldi, the naturalisation
   letters obtained through Cardinal de la Valette).
2. **The cipher runs fall at the same points**, after the same clear words: "en laquelle il aura laissé",
   "dont nous esperons estre bientost esclaircis", "au nom de ce prétendu comte de", "besoing de ce",
   "Vous scaurez maintenant que", "Toutes ces propositions", "il nous faut continuer ceste mesme routte
   jusques".
3. **The groups match where checked.** No. 25's first run opens `to 92 … 17 … 43 …` and no. 26's opens
   `to 92 g 17 ᴢ 43 x …`; the third run ends `… 68 93 …` in both, with a short final group after it. The
   two clerks' hands differ enough that individual figures are read differently at this resolution, so I
   have not claimed a group-for-group identity, only that the runs correspond.

## 3. What the letter says

The despatch of an ambassador in Rome's own government to him on the eve of the Treaty of Monzón. Its
ciphered passages are precisely the sensitive ones, and they concern three things:

* **The Valtelline.** Herbault waits on news of the papal Legate's departure for Spain and of the last
  resolution in which he will have left *"le Pape pour l'acheminement de ces troupes in la Valt(eline)"* —
  the affair deserving *"l'envoy d'un courrier exprez"* — *"principallement sy le Pape entroit dans la
  partialité"*, the fear that Urban VIII would take a side.
* **The peace with the Huguenots and the maritime powers.** The peace is holding and welcome even to those
  who had most loudly urged "le chastiment et la guerre contre les huguenots", because — in cipher — "les
  affaires de cet estat avoyent besoing de ce relasche, et que le faix d'une double guerre ne se pouvoit
  plus supporter", while "les affections de noz voysins qui font profession de ceste religion pretendue
  refformée estoyent grandement alterés". Then the English and Dutch: part of the Dutch ships had withdrawn,
  and the Huguenot admiral (read as Soubise) followed "depuis sept ou huict jours avec le reste de sa
  flotte", their departure ordered by the States "sans permission de Sa Ma[jes]té ny de Mons[ieu]r
  l'Admiral", and precisely at the moment peace was concluded.
* **The attempt to push France into war with Spain.** The prince of Piedmont reached Paris on Monday the
  9th; once the King is back from the hunt he will begin to treat. All his propositions, in cipher, "tendent
  à engager le Roy à la guerre avec l'Espagne, (et que) la Seig[neu]rie de Venize contribue comme faict
  l'Angleterre et Holande" — but the King "escoutera tout ce qu'il luy sera representé, et scaura bien
  prendre la resolution convenable au bien de ses affaires". Six weeks later France settled with Spain
  separately at Monzón, leaving Venice and Savoy out; this is the Savoyard push that settlement defeated.

A closing practical passage, also part-ciphered, weighs keeping the ordinary courier route against going by
the Grisons, rejected for "d'autres longueurs et incommoditez, outre la despense".

## 4. What remains

* The key itself is not tabulated. Doing it needs the groups aligned to the glossed words, which the
  decipherer's placement only loosely indicates. It is unnecessary for this reading, and the volume holds
  roughly thirty further letters of 1625–26 in the same cipher, nearly all glossed, for anyone who wants
  the table.
* Two person-names read only from the gloss and uncertain in the palaeography: the "S[ieu]r de Santriny"
  who made a proposition, and the "prétendu comte de Montembelans" in whose name it was made.
* "L'admiral Soubise" is an identification from context (a Huguenot admiral with a fleet in February 1626);
  the gloss itself is hard to read.
* Whether either copy, or the series, is in print was not checked.

## 5. Files

`fetch.sh` (openings), `region.sh` (one page), `zoom.sh` (an upscaled IIIF region),
`ct/letter_13feb1626.md` (the reading), `src/` (the IIIF manifest and the BnF notice), `img/` and `crops/`
(page images and reading crops, not committed).

Checked: the folio-to-canvas mapping on two foliated leaves; the piece list against the leaves; the
word-for-word identity of the clear text of nos. 25 and 26; the correspondence of the cipher runs and the
matching of groups at the two points named above; the reading of every glossed passage quoted here. Not
checked: a group-by-group identity of the two ciphertexts; the key table; any printed edition. User must
verify: this is a reading of a contemporary decipherment, not an independent decryption, and the two
uncertain proper names are flagged in the transcription.
