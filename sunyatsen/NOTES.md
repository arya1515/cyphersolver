# Telegram to Sun Yat-sen, Swatow → Tokyo, 3 April 1916 (JACAR B03050738800) — SOLVED

Cryptiana list item: "Telegram to Sun Yat-sen (1916)" (unsolved since 2021). The same entry
also lists the Huang Xing telegram (JACAR B03050731500; decoded text filed with it, scheme
unknown) — not attempted here (JACAR's archive host returns 403 to the browser tool).

## Verdict

**Solved.** The telegram is standard Chinese telegraph code (電報新編 numbering) passed
through a *systematic* code condenser of the same family as Yamada Junzaburō's two known
tables: 20 consonants in alphabetical order rotated to start at **l**, five vowel columns in
the order **e a i o u**, numbered column-major 01–99, 00 (so l‑e = 01 … k‑e = 20, l‑a = 21 …
k‑u = 00). No additive. 41 of ~44 characters read; the last three codes are garbled in the
received copy.

```
潮城由莫擎宇獨立。我軍亦光復汕頭。後莫率大隊來，令我退出鎮守府。
我軍力薄，暫由翼□支持。文慧返……［3 codes garbled］                （田中）
```

"Chao[zhou] city has been declared independent by Mo Qingyu. Our army too has recovered
Swatow. Afterwards Mo came at the head of a large force and ordered us out of the garrison
headquarters. Our army is weak; for the present we are supported by 翼□. 文慧 returns …"

This matches the events exactly: Mo Qingyu (莫擎宇), regimental commander at Chaozhou, was
induced by Chen Jiongming, Lin Hu, He Haiming and the local revolutionaries to declare
against Yuan Shikai; he took Chaozhou city (潮城) on 27 March 1916 and wired Long Jiguang
"率師占領潮城，宣布獨立"; on 30 March the Swatow guard troops came over and Mo moved his
headquarters to Swatow — pushing Sun's own men (with whom the Japanese "Tanaka" was
serving) out of the 鎮守使署 they had seized. The telegram went to "Rosamonde Tokio" —
Soong Ching-ling's English name — i.e. to Sun's household, and was intercepted by the
Japanese Foreign Ministry, which could not read it (機密送第一號, 29 Apr 1916).

## The JACAR file (reel 1-0959, frames 0288–0298, MT 161752 1230–1247)

Read from the 11-page PDF supplied by the user (Gaimushō record 680675–680684).

| frame | content |
|---|---|
| 680675–6 | 機密送第○號, 29 Apr 1916, FM Ishii → Consul-General Segawa, Hankow: "孫逸仙ト電報往復ノ件". The Ministry has secretly obtained telegrams passing between Sun and a person at Hankow (the consulate's policeman Saitō); since mid-March they are in cipher. Who is he, why? Decode if possible. Five telegrams attached. |
| 680677–9 | The five telegrams, Tokyo → "Saito, Japanese Consulate, Hankow", 13–24 Apr 1916, four-digit groups (one five-digit) — the +111 additive code Tomokiyo has already read. |
| 680680–1 | 機密送第一號, 29 Apr 1916, Ishii → 田中事務代理 (Tanaka, acting consul, **Swatow**): "孫逸仙宛電報ニ関スル件". A telegram from a "Tanaka" at Swatow to Sun has been obtained; it is in cipher, ten letters to a word; who is this man, why does he write to Sun, is he misusing the consul's name? Investigate secretly and if possible decode. |
| 680682 | **The telegram** (received-message form). From Swatow, No. 1507, 22 words, 3/4/16 6.05 pm, received Tokio 6.05 pm. Address: **Rosamonde Tokio**. |
| 680683–4 | 政機密第二八號, 11 May 1916, Segawa (Hankow) → Ishii. Reports the *new* scheme of Sun's telegram of 10 May: regroup five-digit → four-digit, reverse digits, subtract 111, standard code (0452 → 2540 → 2429 文). Nothing on the Swatow telegram. |

The file therefore contains no Japanese solution of the Swatow telegram; the Swatow
consulate's reply to 機密送第一號 would be a separate item.

## Ciphertext (frame 680682)

Tomokiyo's transcription:

```
Twelve baxuxupeja qicijinati bemigasiqi jakebiqoye kufohemige tuxaboboba
gedoeijiga poyevayoxa leyoleveke biromapesa vorobenife xikebiqoye qekufiyaqa
tijaqixiqo xitohatula xopavajejo ropezpo ngobunibai tanaka
```

22 words = Rosamonde Tokio + Twelve + 16 ten-letter groups + ropezpo + ngobunibai + tanaka.
177 code letters; consonants exactly the 20 of Yamada's condensers (no w); vowels a e i o u.
Vowel counts i 22, e 21, a 20, o 19, **u 7**: the rarity of u pointed to a vowel-major table
with u = the 80s–90s block, which the codebook scarcely uses for page numbers.

Checking the JACAR image (cryptiana's crop, `img/sun_telegram.png`) against the
transcription: the form actually reads **gedocijiga** (not -eiji-) and **xitonatula**
(not -hat-); **kufohemige** is h/n-ambiguous and **baxuxupeja** may be baxuxepeja. All four
are exactly the emendations the decipherment requires (莫, 支, 光, 城).

## Method

1. `parse.py` — syllable statistics (above).
2. `family.py` — brute force of the systematic family: 40 consonant orders (20 rotations ×
   forward/reverse) × 120 vowel orders × {row-major, column-major} × {00-, 01-based} ×
   additive {0, ±111} = 57 600 keys. Each key decodes the clean syllable runs to 4-digit
   codes, scored by a traditional-Chinese character unigram model (jieba word list → OpenCC
   S→T; `build_lm.py`). Codebook = Unihan kTaiwanTelegraph / kMainlandTelegraph tables
   (`tw.csv`, `cn.csv`; Tomokiyo's decoded telegrams confirm the 1916 numbering is the same).
   Result: the winning key scores −360.6 against a population mean of −553.6 (sd 23.8) and
   is 49 points clear of the runner-up (`family_out.txt`, `show.py`).
3. `fix.py` / `lookup.py` — one-letter alternatives for the four doubtful codes, chosen by
   sense (光復, 支持, 莫, 潮城) and then confirmed against the handwriting.
4. `tail.py` — edit-distance search over the 13 letters after 返 (`zpongobunibai`); nothing
   within ≤3 plausible edits decodes to valid codes: at least one letter is lost in
   `ropezpo` (a 7-letter "word" is impossible in this system) and `ngobunibai` is not a CV
   string. Needs a high-resolution look at the second sheet of frame 680682.
5. `decode.py` — final annotated decoding → `decode_out.txt`.

## Confirmed cells of the table

Every syllable in a word that reads (潮, 由, 莫擎宇, 獨立, 我軍, 亦, 復, 汕頭, 後, 率大隊來,
令, 退出, 鎮守府, 力薄, 暫由, 持, 返) checks the systematic layout: 46 of the 50 distinct
syllables received are confirmed by sense; the four that are not (xu, he, ha, to) are the
four misread/uncertain ones. ku = 00 (亦 0076, 力 0500) fixes the u-column.

## Open points

* **9004 → 城 (1004)**: needs xu → xe. 潮城 is what Mo himself called the town; 潮州 (1558),
  潮梅 (2734), 潮汕 (3073) are all impossible from the letters.
* **翼□ (5065 5068)**: 5065 = 翼 is sent with two well-confirmed syllables; 5068 (xi to) is
  翿 in the modern table — 'to' could be a misread ('te' 5008 罹, 'ta' 5028 羣, 'yo' 5071 老 …).
  Probably a name or unit that "supported" the revolutionaries after Mo displaced them.
* **文慧 (2429 1979)**: read as sent; perhaps a person ("文慧 returns [to Tokyo?]"). 2429 is
  also Sun Wen's own signature character.
* **Tail** after 返: `zpo ngobunibai` — ~3 codes, unrecoverable from this copy.
* The Huang Xing telegram (B03050731500) is kana-based; with its filed plaintext it should
  yield to the same known-plaintext approach, but JACAR must be read by hand.

## The tail, checked on the sheet (2026-09-15, second session)

The JACAR PDF was re-fetched (`jacar/sun.pdf`, 11 pages; raw path
`/content/item/aj12/C200139000900/raw/B03050738800.b10149.1-0959.00000288.pdf`) and frame 0296, the two sheets of the
received-message form (paper nos. 44 and 45), rendered at 600 dpi (`jacar/f0296_tail_rot.png`). The second sheet
carries two lines in a clear copperplate: **xopavajejo ropezpo / ngobunibai tanaka**. Every letter of the tail is as
Tomokiyo transcribed it; there is no h/n or e/c ambiguity to exploit here as there was in *kufonemige* and
*gedocijiga*. So the garble is the operator's, not the transcriber's: after **ro pe** (返) the thirteen letters
`zpo ngobunibai` cannot be parsed into consonant-vowel pairs at any edit distance of three or less (`tail.py`), and
the three lost characters stay lost. The "high-resolution look" this file asked for has been taken and closes
the point.

## The wider series (2026-09-18)

The Ministry of Communications' intercept files (JACAR B03050088300 … B03050090200) hold dozens more telegrams
in the same condenser family, each correspondent with its own key. See `y1916/NOTES.md` and `y1917/NOTES.md`. The Swatow
operator original is not in B03050088300 or B03050088400.
