# Mascon's cipher (Charles Hémard de Denonville, cardinal de Mâcon, Rome 1535-1537)

Sources: G. Lasry's table for BnF fr. 3071 f. 9 (img/BnF_fr3071_f9.png); S. Tomokiyo's reconstruction from
BnF fr. 3053 (img/francisMacon*.png; cryptiana "francis.htm", section "BnF fr.3053 (1535-1537)").
Homophonic substitution, one glyph = one letter (plus a few doubled-letter signs), nulls, and a small code list.
No word division; the scribe leaves small gaps that often (not always) fall at word breaks.

| U/V | superscript "m" over a "5/ʒ" ("ᵐ₅") | `m` |

| null | "·r·" dotted small r (Tomokiyo) - see note | `n` |
| null | "c—" hook with a long tail; "E" | `~` |

Code groups (Tomokiyo): `30` = pape, `40` = (le) roy. Written with the digits clearly as a pair (not "3" + "o").

## Notes and corrections found while reading fr. 3071 no. 4

* The letter table above was checked against Lasry's glyph table (img/BnF_fr3071_f9.png, enlarged in work_macon/kA-kF.png)
  and reads French throughout f. 9r lines 3-25 with no substitution change needed. Confirmed in running text:
  A = 3/8/+, C = 4, D = 5, E = 9 / ring-with-tail / ring-with-cross, I = triangle / slanted bar / #, L = 10 / x,
  N = 7, O = f / D, P = hairpin / double-barred stroke, R = "27" / dotted r, S = 6 / reversed 9, T = big looped G / curly X,
  U/V = pound-sign / superscript m over 5 / bow-tie, RR = triple bar on stem ("pierre", "corrompre", "Novarre", "declarer").
* **New code group: `20` = l'Empereur** (inferred, not in the tables): "a la devotion du dict 20", "se declarer
  partial de 20"; context (pope drifting to the Emperor's side if the marriages go ahead) leaves no real alternative.
* `30` = pape (glossed "le dict pappe" interlinear by a contemporary decipherer at f. 9r l. 4); `40` = roy
  ("la confederation du 40 avec le Turc").
* The dotted small r ("·r·") often appears where no letter is needed (after "au" in "audict", after "t" in
  "tseigneur", at line ends): treated as a null here, in agreement with Tomokiyo's null list. Where it must be R
  ("r r" in "corrompre"?) the double form probably reads RR rather than R+R: uncertain.
* The long "ſ / ∫" hairpin with one or two long descenders is P (not a null); a doubled "ſſ" at a word start on f. 9v
  may be a separate sign (unresolved; marked `[ſſ]`).
* Hard pairs in this hand: "4" (C) vs "24/27" (R) - the R sign is often written so compactly it looks like a 4,
  causing "declacant" for "declarant", "craindce" for "craindre"; "q" (M, 9 with crossbar) vs "ᴧa" (Q) - in l. 25
  "ce qu'il" came out "ce iuil", i.e. the q-sign was misread by me as the slanted-bar I; "7" (N) vs "q" (M).
