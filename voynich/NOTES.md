# Voynich manuscript (Beinecke MS 408): one-session adjudication, 2026-09-15

Not a decipherment. The question set was: hoax or meaningless text, cipher, or language, and how far the
evidence can be pushed in one session. Method: five literature sweeps (one per hypothesis or evidence
class), six fresh computational tests on the public transliterations against natural-language corpora and
against implemented hoax generators, an adversarial re-run of every test by a separate agent, and this
write-up. Every number below is either **(S)** computed this session by a named script in this directory
(a1 to a6, re-run and where necessary corrected by v_a1 to v_a6; corrected figures are the ones quoted) or
**(L)** quoted from the literature as returned by the sweeps and recorded in `SOURCES.md`. Judgement is
marked with an asterisk. Two independent baseline scripts (`baseline.py`, `baseline2.py`) written before
the agents ran reproduce the a1/a2 headline numbers (h2 2.32 raw EVA without spaces, Zipf slope -1.04,
adjacent repeats 0.81%).

## 1. Verdict and confidence

**Established, and not disputed by anyone serious (L).** The object is a genuine early-15th-century codex:
vellum radiocarbon-dated 1404-1438 on four folios, iron-gall ink and period pigments throughout text and
drawings, five scribal hands sharing one writing system, provenance continuous from Prague c.1600 through
Baresch (1639), Marci (1665) and Kircher to 1912. The modern-forgery idea is dead.

**Excluded with high confidence*, robust to the transliteration (S).** That the text is a plaintext, a
one-to-one substitution, a letter transposition, a vowel-less (abjad) rendering, or a single-glyph-null
padding of any of eleven European languages tested (Latin, Italian, German, English, French, Danish,
Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Finnish) in ordinary word segmentation. Conditional character entropy
h2 is 2.18 to 2.35 bits in raw EVA and 2.66 to 2.89 bits under three independent glyph segmentations,
against a natural-language floor of 3.32 bits; any transposition of Latin gives at least 3.44; vowel
deletion leaves Latin at 3.52. This confirms Bennett (1976), Zandbergen and Lindemann & Bowern (2021) (L),
with the added point that it survives glyph merging and the Currier and v101 alphabets.

**Disfavoured*.** An unenciphered low-entropy non-European language (nearest published h2 is 2.77,
Hawaiian; L). Every published decipherment from Bax 2014 to the 2025-2026 LLM-assisted readings (L: none
has a reproducible key or survives blind application). Rugg's table-and-grille as the actual mechanism, and
free-edit self-citation as implemented here (section 5).

**Live, and not separated by this session or by the field (S, L).** (a) A verbose or positional cipher or
constructed encoding in which one plaintext unit becomes a rigid two- or three-glyph group, possibly with a
nomenclator; (b) structured meaningless text produced by a slot-preserving copy-and-modify procedure.
Every statistic that separates Voynichese from language is reproduced by at least one member of each
class. Judgement*: roughly even, perhaps 45:50 for (a):(b), with the remaining few percent on an
unenciphered exotic language. The three research camps reached the same shape of disagreement in 2022
(L: Gaskell & Bowern 2022 and Bowern & Gaskell 2022 published as a pair, one showing human gibberish
matches the statistics, the other showing ciphers do too).

## 2. Strongest counterargument first

All character statistics assume the transliteration and that EVA spaces mark plaintext units. Latin
re-segmented after {e, s, m} moves 60% of the way to Voynichese slot rigidity, and Latin cut into
vowel-final syllables is more rigid than Voynichese at equal length (S: v_a3). The exclusion therefore
covers word-boundary-preserving encodings of eleven languages in modern orthography; rule-based
re-segmentation, or a language with rigid consonant-vowel syllables written syllabically, was not tested.
Second, the verbose control that matches raw EVA on h1, h2 and their ratio at once produces words 2.3 times
too long (11.5 against 5.07 symbols) with Latin word entropy, so a letter-level verbose cipher of whole
Latin words is refuted by the session's own word-level data (S: v_a1). Both narrow the verdict; neither
overturns it.

## 3. Data

(S) ZL3b-n (Zandbergen-Landini, EVA, voynich.nu, version of 13 May 2025), paragraph text only, 34,116
tokens after dropping words with an unread glyph or extended-EVA codes; Currier A about 10,750 tokens,
B about 22,900; 7,236 word types. Cross-checked on RF1b-er, IT2a (Takahashi), GC2a (v101) and CD2a
(Currier). Parsed with `parse_ivtff.py`; uncertain word spaces (IVTFF commas, 2,463 in paragraph text)
were treated as breaks, and v_a2 shows the joined variant changes nothing material. Language controls are
single Gutenberg books (verse and prose distinguished where it matters) and an OCR'd 16th-century Italian
corpus containing about 8% Latin tokens (S: v_a1, v_a3). Entropies are plug-in; Miller-Madow correction
changes h2 by at most 0.007 (S: v_a1).

## 4. Key statistics (S)

### 4.1 Character entropies, bits, no spaces (a1, v_a1, v_a5)

| Text | h1 | h2 | h1-h2 | h2/h1 | mean word length |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ZL raw EVA, Currier A | 3.832 | 2.353 | 1.479 | 0.614 | 4.98 |
| ZL raw EVA, Currier B | 3.859 | 2.182 | 1.677 | 0.565 | 5.12 |
| ZL raw EVA, all | 3.865 | 2.311 | 1.554 | 0.598 | 5.07 |
| ZL merged (benches, i/e groups, aiin, qo) | 4.039 | 2.870 | 1.170 | 0.710 | 3.7-3.9 |
| GC v101 (68 symbols) | 4.144 | 2.893 | 1.25 | 0.698 | 3.7-4.0 |
| Currier CD2a (35 symbols) | 3.857 | 2.660 | 1.197 | 0.690 | |
| Latin, Aeneid | 4.025 | 3.510 | 0.515 | 0.872 | 5.77 |
| German (diacritics folded 3.335) | 4.160 | 3.391 | 0.769 | 0.815 | 4.88 |
| Range of 11 languages (floor 3.32 folded) | 3.94-4.52 | 3.32-3.88 | 0.49-0.77 | 0.82-0.88 | 4.2-6.6 |
| Latin, vowels removed | 3.659 | 3.515 | 0.144 | 0.961 | 3.11 |
| Verbose cipher of Latin, every letter 2-3 symbols, 24 symbols | 3.901 | 2.325 | 1.576 | 0.596 | 11.52 |
| Verbose cipher, 8 letters kept single | 4.102 | 2.916 | 1.186 | 0.711 | 7.64 |

The redundancy is inside words: within-word h2 is 1.92 to 2.13 raw against 2.94 to 3.41 for languages.
Positional mutual information between glyph and position in word is 0.69 to 0.73 bits across ZL, Currier
and v101 against 0.17 to 0.27 for languages; 21 to 31% of glyphs are locked to one word position against
0 to 8% of letters (S: a5, v_a5). Greedy pair merging of the glyph stream closes the h1-h2 gap only after
about 40 merges, so an encoding of two- to three-glyph units drawn from 50 to 60 unit types is compatible
with the character statistics, a plain letter cipher is not (S: a5). The verifier's caveat stands: greedy
merging tests one heuristic, not the whole verbose class (S: v_a5). Word-level information budget:
425,468 bits, 12.47 bits per token, 0.82 times a Latin prose text of equal length under the same model
(S: a5, v_a5).

### 4.2 Zipf, hapax, vocabulary growth, 34,116 tokens (a2, v_a2)

| Corpus | Zipf slope, ranks 1-1000 | hapax % of types | Heaps beta | top-word share |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Voynich all | -1.040 | 69.7 | 0.710 | 2.25% |
| Voynich A / B | -0.994 / -1.068 | 72.2 / 68.6 | 0.743 / 0.679 | 4.27% / 2.13% |
| Latin (Aeneid) | -0.820 | 67.0 | 0.749 | 4.9% |
| German | -1.045 | 65.1 | 0.779 | 3.46% |
| English | -1.056 | 55.1 | 0.675 | 4.68% |

All language-like, as the literature says (L: Landini 2001, Reddy & Knight 2011). Word-type entropy is
9.8 to 10.3 bits against 10.3 to 10.8 for Latin prose and 9.4 to 9.8 for Italian, French and German
(S: v_a1). The low top-word share is an A+B mixture effect (S: v_a2). Against single-book samples the
hapax rate is above every language, not inside the range (S: v_a5).

### 4.3 Word length, merged EVA (a2, v_a2)

| Corpus | mean | variance | variance / mean of (length-1) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voynich all (raw EVA 5.07 / 3.73 / 0.92) | 4.11 | 2.48 | 0.80 |
| Voynich A | 3.93 | 2.89 | 0.99 |
| Voynich B | 4.20 | 2.27 | 0.71 |
| Aeneid alone / Confessions alone | | 4.97 / | 1.04 / 1.74 |
| Italian / German / English / Danish | 4.53 / 4.99 / 4.23 / 4.67 | 6.52 / 7.04 / 5.41 / 7.40 | 1.85 / 1.77 / 1.67 / 2.02 |

Correction from the verifier: the famous under-dispersion ("binomial word lengths") is a Currier-B
property; Currier A matches single-text Latin verse. The binomial-fit contrast in a2 was a search-cap
artefact.

### 4.4 Word grammar rigidity and repetition (a3, v_a3, a2)

| Statistic | Voynich | Latin | Italian | German | English |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pair-order violations against the best glyph order, length-matched (shuffle null 0.49) | 0.160 (v101 0.140) | 0.363 | 0.318 | 0.278 | 0.308 |
| Adjacent identical tokens, % and observed:shuffled | 0.907 / 2.5 | 0.047 / 0.1 | 0.047 / 0.1 | 0.157 / 0.3 | 0.137 / 0.2 |
| Line-initial first-glyph effect, Cramer's V, paragraph-first lines excluded | 0.277 | pseudo-lined prose 0.02-0.03; hexameter 0.148 | | | |

Voynichese is 1.7 to 2.3 times more rigid than any tested language. The glyph order derived from the
data with no assumptions, q, then p f sh, then ch, then o t k, then e ee, then d s a, then l r y, then
g n iin m, is the Stolfi and Zandbergen layout recovered blind (S: a3). The line-final effect reported by
a2 collapses to V 0.07 to 0.16 once the final m and g allographs are removed; the line-initial effect
survives and exceeds hexameter verse (S: v_a2).

### 4.5 Self-citation distances (a4, v_a4)

Nearest earlier token at edit distance at most 1 on the same page, every corpus poured into the identical
page and line skeleton:

| Corpus | median distance | within 10 tokens | within-page shuffle | global shuffle | long tokens (5+) within 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Voynich ZL | 14 | 0.269 | 0.238 | 0.167 | 0.225 |
| Latin (Aeneid) | 41 | 0.035 | 0.034 | 0.030 | 0.006 |
| English (Italian, German similar) | 17 | 0.176 | 0.177 | 0.164 | 0.019 |
| Danish (verse) | 15 | 0.196 | 0.172 | 0.138 | 0.035 |
| Autocopist (Timm-Schinner re-implementation) | 13 | 0.329 | 0.275 | 0.079 | 0.257 |
| Rugg grille | 36 | 0.067 | 0.249 | 0.066 | 0.033 |
| Rugg sorted table | 34 | 0.329 | 0.162 | 0.112 | 0.341 |
| Order-3 character Markov model trained on Voynichese | 19 | 0.194 | 0.194 | 0.194 | 0.119 |

Sequential excess (real minus within-page shuffle): Voynich +0.031, Danish verse +0.024, autocopist
+0.054, prose about zero. Page-vocabulary excess (real minus global shuffle): Voynich +0.102, languages at
most +0.058, autocopist +0.250. For long tokens the language baselines collapse to 0.035 or less while
Voynichese stays at 0.225, but a memoryless character model reaches 0.119: about half of that density is
word-internal structure, not copying (S: v_a4). Brute-force Levenshtein reproduced every Voynich locality
figure exactly.

### 4.6 Generator comparison (a4, v_a4, a3)

| Text | types | h2 raw | h2 merged | Zipf slope | hapax % | adjacent repeat | pair-violation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Voynich ZL | 7,236 | 2.311 | 2.646 | -1.040 | 69.7 | 0.0082 | 0.160 |
| Autocopist, two seeds | 11,660 / 11,330 | 2.709 / 2.723 | 3.274 / 3.005 | -0.825 / -0.859 | 72.2 / 71.1 | 0.0013 / 0.0018 | free-edit 0.41-0.46 |
| Rugg grille / sorted table | 3,747 / 1,757 | 2.798 / 2.629 | 3.176 / 2.912 | -0.429 / -0.622 | 5.7 / 13.9 | 0.0003 / 0.0893 | fitted table 0.122 |

No generator matches on all columns. The autocopist yields only 37% real Voynich word types by token,
2% qo-initial words against 15%, and h2 0.4 to 0.6 bits too high; it is this session's re-implementation
of the published algorithm with documented deviations, not Timm's reference program. Grilles fail Zipf
and hapax. The one table that reproduces the slot rigidity had its columns read off Voynichese, which shows
sufficiency only (S: v_a3).

### 4.7 Currier A and B (a6, v_a6)

| Statistic | A | B |
|---|---|---|
| Tokens ending -edy / containing ed | 0.20% / 0.29% | 17.34% / 20.84% |
| Containing cho / starting qo- / ending -ol | 16.1 / 10.0 / 14.5% | 2.7 / 17.7 / 7.1% |
| Glyph after ch: e / o | 24.5 / 46.1% | 60.1 / 10.1% |
| daiin per thousand tokens | 42.5 | 13.0 |

Unsupervised folio clustering recovers Currier's labels at 95.4 to 99.5% on 197 folios; a single -edy
threshold separates them at 99.5% leave-one-out, A a spike (112 of 114 folios below 2%), B a continuum
from 3 to 42%; the same in IT2a. The language is nearly a function of the scribe: H(language | hand) =
0.09 bits, 98.2% of lines predicted from hand alone, the only mixed cell being hand 3 in the stars section.
Vocabulary sharing A against B, size-matched, gives Jaccard 0.147 and top-100 overlap 0.95, against 0.207
and 1.00 for two halves of A, 0.172 and 0.91 for two English novels, 0.116 and 0.67 for Danish against
Norwegian. A word-final pattern moving from 0.2% to 17% has no parallel between books in one language but
does between languages (French against Italian, final -o 0.19% to 17.5%) (S: v_a6). Section-specific
vocabulary exists (mean chi-square per token 0.654 against 0.121 shuffled and 0.40 for Italian) and
persists within one scribe and one language, but the section words are members of the same sub-word
families, qokain, qol, qokeedy, okeol, rather than anything that looks like content vocabulary (S: v_a6).
Parisel's 2026 preprint reaches the same single-switch description independently (L).

## 5. Hypothesis status

**Excluded.** (1) Plaintext or monoalphabetic substitution of the eleven tested languages: h2 gap at
least 1.0 bit raw, at least 0.4 bit merged (S: a1, v_a1; L: Bennett 1976, Zandbergen, Lindemann & Bowern
2021). (2) Substitution plus vowel removal or conventional abbreviation (S: a1, a5; L). (3) Letter-level
transposition of a real plaintext, including grille rearrangement (S: v_a5; L). (4) Vigenere-type
polyalphabetics (L: Stolfi 2000, D'Imperio 1978). (5) Single-glyph nulls as the source of the redundancy
(S: a5). (6) Named decipherments: Cheshire 2019 (L: refuted by its reviewers), Hauer & Kondrak 2016 as a
decipherment (L: the authors' own caveat), Bax 2014, Gibbs 2017, Ardic, Gladyseva 2023, Schechter 2025 and
the LLM-assisted readings (L: no reproducible key, none survives blind application). (7) Modern forgery
(L: radiocarbon, ink, provenance).

**Disfavoured*.** An unenciphered exotic language (L: nearest h2 2.77; the slot grammar has no parallel).
Rugg's grille as the mechanism: Cardan grilles date from about 1550 against 1404-1438 vellum, the special
roles of f and p cannot arise from the table (L: Zandbergen 2021), and the session's grilles fail Zipf and
hapax (S: a4). Free-edit self-citation: it over-produces locality and vocabulary and under-produces
character redundancy, while the manuscript's sequential copying excess is only the size of Danish verse
(S: a4, v_a4). Dee and Kelly glossolalia (L: Daruka 2020; conflicts with the vellum date).

**Live.** (a) A verbose or slot-template cipher of short units, a nomenclator, or a constructed language
with meaning: compatible with 4.1, 4.4 and 4.7 and with a hand-executable 15th-century design that
reproduces several headline statistics (L: Greshko 2025, the Naibbe cipher; Bowern & Gaskell 2022), but it
must also meet the word-length constraint (verbose controls give 7.6 to 11.5 symbols; S: v_a1), the
near-zero token-to-token predictability (L: Rozanova & Temerev 2026, preprint) and the line-initial effect
(S: v_a2). (b) Slot-preserving copy-and-modify generation (L: Timm & Schinner 2020, 2023; Timm 2026):
compatible with everything measured, but the slot grammar is an input to that model, not a product
(S: a3), and no implementation has been run at manuscript length against page, section and scribe
structure (L: consensus of all three sweeps). (c) A real language under a non-word segmentation:
untested (S: v_a3).

## 6. What the physical evidence adds (L)

Radiocarbon 1404-1438 from four folios (Hodgins, University of Arizona, 2009). Iron-gall ink and period
pigments (McCrone 2009, Yale 2014). Five hands, three of them writing 188 of the 227 pages (Davis 2020),
and this session finds Currier language almost determined by hand (S: a6). The codex is misbound relative
to its quire marks. Month names in a Romance dialect and a German-hand marginal note on f116v put it in
German- and French/Occitan-speaking hands within decades. Multispectral images of ten folios, taken in 2014
and released in 2024, recovered an erased alphabet trial on f1r and Tepenecz's ex libris, not new
Voynichese. Consequence for the question: any meaningless-text account must be a 1420s production on fresh
calfskin by several collaborating scribes who kept one slot grammar and one A/B switch consistent across
200-plus pages, which is a cost that no statistic addresses; any cipher account must explain why the scribe
rather than the subject matter sets the "language". Ink layering, pigment order and quire order were not
examined here.

## 7. What would settle the rest

1. A pre-registered generator bake-off at manuscript length: self-citation, table-and-grille, Naibbe-
   enciphered Latin and human gibberish under one battery that includes the Montemurro-Zanette long-range
   keyword peak, topic by illustration by scribe co-clustering, page-adjacency similarity, A/B separability,
   the f and p rules and the token-predictability measure. Scripts a1 to a6 are a partial battery that runs
   on any candidate text in the TSV format.
2. Manuscript-length human gibberish written over weeks with illustrations and sections (L: the open test
   named by Gaskell & Bowern 2022).
3. Illustration-to-text mutual information with hand, quire and adjacency partialled out.
4. Re-tokenisation on certain spaces only, and the same statistics on a syllabic segmentation of Latin and
   Italian, to close the gap left in section 2.
5. For any claimed key: blind application by a third party to five A and five B folios with a
   shuffled-glyph control.

## 8. Checked, not checked, user must verify

**Checked.** Every headline number in a1 to a6 was reproduced by an independent re-implementation
(v_a1 to v_a6), including the Levenshtein code, the entropy formulas, estimator bias, corpus contents and
Gutenberg boilerplate. Robustness across ZL, RF1b, IT2a, GC2a and CD2a. Corrections applied: single-book
samples; Latin word entropy from prose not verse; a folded natural-language floor of 3.32; rigidity ratio
1.7 to 2.3; under-dispersion as a Currier-B property; the line-final effect as the m/g allograph; the A/B
rule at 99.5% leave-one-out. My own two baseline scripts agree with a1 and a2.

**Not checked.** Paywalled Cryptologia full texts (Rugg 2004, Schinner 2007, Timm & Schinner 2020 and
2023, Daruka 2020, Greshko 2025) were characterised from abstracts and secondary summaries. Timm's
reference generator was not run. Higher-order entropies, per-hand entropies, significance tests on A
against B, bootstrap intervals. No higher-level literature statistic (the Montemurro-Zanette peak, topic
models, adjacent-page similarity) was recomputed. Davis's hand assignments were taken as given from the
IVTFF headers. Physical evidence beyond radiocarbon, ink, hands and the 1639 letter.

**User must verify before quoting.** The corpus choices (single Gutenberg books; an OCR Italian corpus
with about 8% Latin; verse against prose Latin), the glyph merge lists, the design of the 24-symbol
verbose controls, the treatment of uncertain spaces as breaks, and the labels excluded, disfavoured and
live. All output is unvalidated until review.
