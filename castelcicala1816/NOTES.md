# Castelcicala (London, Paris) to Naples, 1816–1823: ASNa Esteri 2337 — catalogue 166 and 167

Outcome: read in part (21 Sept 2026). Code structure, correspondents and dates established; key rebuilt from four
contemporary interlinear decipherments; 45% of the groups in the target letters get a value, but no letter reads
through. Attempted, open for the rest.

Catalogue 167 (R9553, R9555–R9557, R9582–R9586, seen first, below) and catalogue 166: "Marchese di Ciscello? Principe di Castelcicala? (Paris) to unknown recipient, 15 ciphertexts",
DECODE R9554–R9588 (ASNa, Ministero degli affari esteri, busta 2337, items 5–39).

## Who and when

- Sender: Fabrizio Ruffo, principe di Castelcicala, Neapolitan ambassador in London and then Paris. He signs
  R9562, R9566, R9569, R9571, R9579, R9587 and R9589.
- **"Marchese di Ciscello" is the recipient, misread.** The address reads "Eccmo Sig.r Marchese di **Circello**
  ... Napoli" (Tommaso di Somma, foreign minister) on R9554, R9558–R9566 and others. The 1823 letters (R9569–R9571,
  R9589) go to Cavaliere Luigi de' Medici. So DECODE's "unknown recipient" is known.
- Dates from the headings: London 26 Sep, 4 Oct 1816 (R9579, R9558); Paris 17, 19, 23 Oct, 30 Nov, 1 and 3 Dec 1816
  (R9559, R9560, R9587, R9561, R9566, R9562); several undated (nos. 2589, 2814, 3388/3588, 3721, 4086); Paris
  4, 8, 11? Sept and 9 Oct 1823 (R9569, R9571, R9570, R9589). R9553/R9555–R9557 (London, Paris 1816) and
  R9582–R9585 (1817–19 fragments) are further letters in the same code.
- Page order in the images is not reading order: R9579 runs P2, P3, P1, P4; R9569 P2, P1; R9561 starts at P2.
  R9566 holds despatch 3874 (P3, P2, P4) plus a fragment in another hand (P1, P5, P6).

## The code

- Numeric groups 1–~2450 with dots, one code for 1816 and 1823. Units are syllables, common words and names
  (el-e-zione, pon-ti-fi-ca-to, cas-ti-gli-one, par-lan-do-gli; Francia 2353, Spagna 2054, Duca 1529).
- Homophonic: di = 1112 / 2211, del = 2082, ere = 1836 / 2381, pa = 1201 / 2363.
- Two-part but with **local alphabetical runs**: 2201 che, 2205 ci, 2211 di, 2221 fi, 2230 l, 2231 l', 2232 la;
  2082 del, 2083 dell', 2084 della; 2045 quella, 2049 questo; 2161 is, 2162 Isola; 1111 detta, 1112 di; 1919 no,
  1920 non; 2445 ter, 2448 ti, 2450 to. Across runs the order is scattered.
- **Nulls:** a group written with a fifth figure (21900, 18900, 16480, …, ~100 cases) stands where the
  contemporary gloss has nothing. 1531 is probably a null too (ele-1531-zione = elezione beside ele-va-zione).
- R9586 and R9588 are in a different code (values 100–1100, faint pencil syllabic glosses); not attacked.
- Some pages (R9554 p1, R9561 P4–P7) have a stroke over nearly every group: a later decoder's ticks, recorded only
  where sparse.

## Cribs used

Contemporary interlinear decipherments, all in busta 2337:
- R9566 p3, first ten lines (despatch 3874, 1 Dec 1816): "questo Ministro dell'Interno Conte Decazes che gode
  sempre del più gran favore presso del Re di Francia ha avuto una conferenza col Ministro di S.M. Cattolica Sig.r
  Onis al suo passaggio per qui, nella quale parlandogli della cessione delle Floride, e di quella di cui si è
  parlato dell'Isola di Cuba all'Inghilterra gli ha insinuato destramente…"
- R9571 (8 Sept 1823): France wants Cardinal Castiglioni as Pope; the Duc de Laval blamed; no accord between
  France and Austria on the election.
- R9569 (4 Sept 1823) and R9589 (9 Oct 1823, the Spanish king's liberty; the Duc d'Angoulême not back for two
  months).

## Key and reading

`key.tsv`: 162 values, graded G (glossed, 90), X (glossed and confirmed in a second context, 18), I (inferred
here, 54). `apply.py` decodes; `reading_partial.txt` is the partial decode of every record (unverified; I values
may be wrong, e.g. "il Sr troppo l d'An ta" in R9579 is surely a name). Coverage 45% of target groups.
`solve.py` (it-modern LM candidate scoring) did not discriminate: contexts too sparse, segmentation unknown.

What would move it: hand-reading the 1816 letters against the Florida/Cuba and Decazes crib themes, one letter at a
time, extending runs by alphabetical bracketing; or the code book itself (ASNa Esteri, or Borbone 1666, whose
consular keys R9532–R9541 are on DECODE but are for 1859–60).

## Prior work

DECODE: Non-decrypted. Web search (21 Sept 2026) found no printed decipherment.

## Files

- `decode/fetch.py`, `decode/views_9532_9591.jsonl` (DECODE metadata); images and record pages git-ignored (not public domain).
- `transcripts/R*.txt` transcriptions (with glosses, headers, notes); `cipher/R*.txt` group-only.
- `corpus.py`, `key.tsv`, `apply.py`, `ctx.py`, `solve.py`, `reading_partial.txt`, `profile.json`.

## First pass (catalogue 167)

**Correction to the first pass.** The "decrypted siblings in box 2337" were not all 1850s: R9569, R9570, R9571
and R9589 are Castelcicala's Paris letters of Sept–Oct 1823 in this same code, three with contemporary
interlinear decipherments, and R9566 p3 (1 Dec 1816) has one too. Those glosses are the crib used above.
R9553 is headed "Cifra della Segreteria di Stato": the ministry's general code.


(First pass, 21 Sept 2026, catalogue 167 only; superseded by the section above.)

## What the records are

DECODE R9553, R9555–R9557, R9582–R9586 (ASNa, Ministero degli affari esteri 2337_4…2337_37), 13 images, fetched
with the shared DECODE cookie (images git-ignored in `img/`, metadata in `decode/`).

- Sender: Fabrizio Ruffo, principe di Castelcicala, Neapolitan ambassador (London in 1816, Paris 1815–1832);
  signed "Il Principe di Castelcicala".
- Recipient: **not unknown**. R9553 is addressed "Ecc.mo Sig. Marchese di Circello, S. S. S., Napoli"
  (Tommaso di Somma, Secretary of State for foreign affairs). DECODE leaves the receiver blank.
- R9553 is headed "Cifra della Segreteria di Stato" and numbered 2314: the ministry's general code, not a
  personal one.
- Dates on DECODE: 1 Apr, 3 Jun, 6 Sep, 30 Oct 1816 (London/Paris), 14 Nov 1817, 3 Apr, 13 Jul, 28 Oct 1819; R9586
  undated. The 1819 letters end in clear with "Parigi li …".

## The cipher

A numerical code, groups 14–2460, dots between groups, no word division visible. Almost all groups lie in
1350–2460; low groups (14, 40, 86, 97, 154, 222…) are rare. Some groups in R9585 carry a trailing 0 (15680,
18300, 22321?, 23530, 5810), probably a mark on the base group. Repeated phrases inside one letter (R9553:
"1901 2445 1652 1633" twice, "2358 1726 1454" twice, "1999 1531" four times) show a codebook of words or
syllables, not a letter cipher. 331 groups transcribed from three pages (`transcription.txt`), 208 distinct:
far too few for a ~2,500-entry code to be broken ciphertext-only.

## Where a key could come from, and what was checked

- **Box 2317 plaintexts** (DECODE's note). The only box-2317 record on DECODE is R9549 (2317_1). Its cipher pages
  (a 1798 "Cifra di Vienna" despatch with a clear version, and a letter signed "de Baptiste") use a different
  code: their frequent groups are 441, 486, 563, 1144, 1951, none of which is frequent here, and they stop at
  ~1999. So the box-2317 plaintexts on DECODE do not belong to these ciphertexts.
- **Decrypted siblings in box 2337** (R9550–R9552, R9568–R9581, R9589–R9590) are 1850s–60s telegrams and letters
  (e.g. R9550 Massone, Washington 28 Oct 1859, syllabic code with interlinear reading). Different period, different
  code; not tested further.
- **Print.** Web search (Castelcicala + Circello + cifra/dispacci 1816–1819) found biographies (Treccani DBI) but
  no edition of the ciphered despatches. Not in Tomokiyo's Cryptiana index as far as searched.

## What would move it

The 1816–19 "Cifra della Segreteria di Stato" codebook, or Circello's deciphered copies, in ASNa (Esteri, the
Paris legation series or the Segreteria's cipher office papers). Failing that, a full transcription of catalogue
166 (15 more records, 51 pp., same box, same sender, probably the same code) would roughly quadruple the text,
still short of what a ciphertext-only attack on this code size needs.
